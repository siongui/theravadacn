   * - In line with the present-day stress on the need for religious teachings to be personally relevant and directly verifiable, in certain Dhamma circles the time-honored Buddhist doctrine of rebirth has come up for severe re-examination. Although only a few contemporary Buddhist thinkers still go so far as to suggest that this doctrine be scrapped as "unscientific," another opinion has been gaining ground to the effect that whether or not rebirth itself be a fact, the doctrine of rebirth has no essential bearings on the practice of Dhamma and thence no claim to an assured place in the Buddhist teachings. The Dhamma, it is said, is concerned solely with the here and now, with helping us to resolve our personal hangups through increased self-awareness and inner honesty. All the rest of Buddhism we can now let go as the religious trappings of an ancient culture utterly inappropriate for the Dhamma of our technological age.

     - 現代人對宗教教導強調有必要與個人相關並直接可證，相應地在某些佛教圈子裡，久經考驗的輪迴教說在經受苛刻的重新審查。盡管只有少數幾位當代佛教思想家仍走得過遠，建議將此教說作爲“非科學”予以廢棄，另有一種觀點已開始流行，意謂不管輪迴本身真實與否，輪迴的\ **教說**\對佛法修持無根本重要性，因此在佛法教導中無必要地位。有人說，佛法只關乎即刻當下，助我們藉提升自覺與內在誠實，解決個人難題。佛教的其餘一切，只是一個古老文化的宗教性裝飾，作爲我們當今科技時代的佛法已徹底不合宜，如今可以放棄了。
