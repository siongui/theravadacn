   * - *Anicca vata sankhara* — "Impermanent, alas, are all formations!" — is the phrase used in Theravada Buddhist lands to announce the death of a loved one, but I have not quoted this line here in order to begin an obituary. I do so simply to introduce the subject of this essay, which is the word *sankhara* itself. Sometimes a single Pali word has such rich implications that merely to sit down and draw them out can shed as much light on the Buddha's teaching as a long expository article. This is indeed the case with the word *sankhara*. The word stands squarely at the heart of the Dhamma, and to trace its various strands of meaning is to get a glimpse into the Buddha's own vision of reality.

     - *Anicca vata sankhara*\——“諸行無常!”——這是上座部佛教國家通報親人去世的用語; 不過我在此引用這個偈句，非是作為訃告的開端，僅是為了介紹本文的主題—— *sankhara*\ :small`[行]`\ 這個詞本身。有時候，一個巴利單詞具有如此豐富的內涵，僅僅坐下把它們勾畫出來，對於闡明佛陀的教導，作用不亞於一篇義理長文。\ *Sankhara*\ 一詞的確可當此說。該詞正居於佛法的核心，對其內涵的種種線索探究一番，即是對佛陀本人的現實觀作一管窺。

   * - The word *sankhara* is derived from the prefix *sam*, meaning "together," joined to the noun *kara*, "doing, making." *Sankharas* are thus "co-doings," things that act in concert with other things, or things that are made by a combination of other things. Translators have rendered the word in many different ways: formations, confections, activities, processes, forces, compounds, compositions, fabrications, determinations, synergies, constructions. All are clumsy attempts to capture the meaning of a philosophical concept for which we have no exact parallel, and thus all English renderings are bound to be imprecise. I myself use "formations" and "volitional formations," aware this choice is as defective as any other.

     - *Sankhara* 一詞來自前綴 *sam* 與名詞 *kara* 的組合; 前者意謂“共同”，後者意謂“做、造”。諸行因此就是“合造”，即與其它事物共同行動的事物，或者被其它組合事物造作起來的事物。對這個詞的譯法，衆譯家已有種種表達: 造作、合成、活動、過程、力量、化合、組成、製造、決意、協同、構造。這都是為了把握一個我們並無準確對應的哲學概念所作的粗陋嘗試，因此一切英譯必然是不準確的。我自己用的是 formations (造作)與 volitional formations(有動機的造作/意志的造作)，亦知其缺憾不少於任一別譯。

   * - However, though it is impossible to discover an exact English equivalent for *sankhara*, by exploring its actual usage we can still gain insight into how the word functions in the "thought world" of the Dhamma. In the suttas the word occurs in three major doctrinal contexts. One is in the twelvefold formula of dependent origination (*paticca-samuppada*), where the *sankharas* are the second link in the series. They are said to be conditioned by ignorance and to function as a condition for consciousness. Putting together statements from various suttas, we can see that the *sankharas* are the kammically active volitions responsible for generating rebirth and thus for sustaining the onward movement of samsara, the round of birth and death. In this context *sankhara* is virtually synonymous with *kamma*, a word to which it is etymologically akin.

     - 不過，雖不可能為 *sankhara* 找到一個確切對應的英語詞彙，透過對其用法的探討，我們仍然可對它在佛法 “思維世界”中的功能獲得領悟。在經文中，該詞出現於三類主要的教義語境。一類是十二因緣的連鎖公式，在其中 *sankhara* (行/造作)居系列的第二位。經文中說，它們以無明為緣，又作為意識的緣。把諸經中有關句子歸納起來，我們可以看見，諸行乃是負責造作重生、從而維持生死輪迴繼續運行的有業力活性的意志。在這個語境當中，諸行與語源學上一個相近的詞 *kamma* (業) 基本上同義。

   * - The suttas distinguish the *sankharas* active in dependent origination into three types: bodily, verbal, and mental. Again, the *sankharas* are divided into the meritorious, demeritorious, and "imperturbable," i.e., the volitions present in the four formless meditations. When ignorance and craving underlie our stream of consciousness, our volitional actions of body, speech, and mind become forces with the capacity to produce results, and of the results they produce the most significant is the renewal of the stream of consciousness following death. It is the *sankharas*, propped up by ignorance and fueled by craving, that drive the stream of consciousness onward to a new mode of rebirth, and exactly where consciousness becomes established is determined by the kammic character of the *sankharas*. If one engages in meritorious deeds, the *sankharas* or volitional formations will propel consciousness toward a happy sphere of rebirth. If one engages in demeritorious deeds, the *sankharas* will propel consciousness toward a miserable rebirth. And if one masters the formless meditations, these "imperturbable" *sankharas* will propel consciousness toward rebirth in the formless realms.

     - 經文中把作用於十二因緣的諸行分為三類: 身、語、意。諸行又被分為福行、非福行、以及“不可擾動” —— 即四類無色界禪定中的存在意志。當無明與渴求主宰我們的意識流時，我們身、語、意的有動機行為，便成為造作果報的力量，在它們産生的果報之中，最重要的是死後該意識流的更新。以無明為促進，以渴求為燃料，是諸行推動著意識流，朝下一個重生模式行進，並且，意識的具體立足點，取決於諸行的業力性質。假若某人行福德事，那麼該行或者說“有動機的造作”將會把意識推向喜樂的重生域界。假若某人行損福德事，則將把意識推向痛苦的重生。假若他掌握了無色界禪定，這些“不可擾動”的諸行將推動他的意識流重生於無色界。

   * - A second major domain where the word *sankharas* applies is among the five aggregates. The fourth aggregate is the *sankhara-khandha*, the aggregate of volitional formations. The texts define the *sankhara-khandha* as the six classes of volition *(cha cetanakaya)*: volition regarding forms, sounds, smells, tastes, tactile objects, and ideas. Though these *sankharas* correspond closely to those in the formula of dependent origination, the two are not in all respects the same, for the *sankhara-khandha* has a wider range. The aggregate of volitional formations comprises all kinds of volition. It includes not merely those that are kammically potent, but also those that are kammic results and those that are kammically inoperative. In the later Pali literature the *sankhara-khandha* becomes an umbrella category for all the factors of mind except feeling and perception, which are assigned to aggregates of their own. Thus the *sankhara-khandha* comes to include such ethically variable factors as contact, attention, thought, and energy; such wholesome factors as generosity, kindness, and wisdom; and such unwholesome factors as greed, hatred, and delusion. Since all these factors arise in conjunction with volition and participate in volitional activity, the early Buddhist teachers decided that the most fitting place to assign them is the aggregate of volitional formations.

     - “諸行”一詞的第二個主要應用領域，是作為五蘊之一。第四蘊即為行蘊(*sankhara-khandha*)，也就是有動機的造作的聚集體。經典上把行蘊定義為六類動機(*cha cetanakaya*): 即與色、聲、香、味、觸、法相關的動機。盡管這些“行”與十二因緣公式中的“行”密切對應，兩者並非處處等同，因為行蘊的範疇更為廣泛。有動機的造作蘊\ :small:`[行蘊]`\ 涵攝一切動機種類。不僅包括業力上有活性的造作，也包括造作的業果，還包括那些與業力無關的造作。在後來的巴利文獻中，行蘊成為一個覆蓋了除受蘊與想蘊之外的一切心理素質的類別，前兩項各具獨立的蘊。於是行蘊這個詞便涵攝著諸如接觸、專注、思維、能量等倫理上中性的素質，諸如慷慨、仁慈、智慧等善巧的素質，以及諸如貪、嗔、癡等非善巧的素質。既然這一切素質隨著動機共同升起，並且參與動機的活動，早期佛教導師們認為它們最適合歸類於有動機的造作。
