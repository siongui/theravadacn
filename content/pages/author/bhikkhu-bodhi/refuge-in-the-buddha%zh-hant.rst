   * - The first step in entering the Buddhist path is going for refuge to the Triple Gem, and the first of the three gems that we approach as refuge is the Buddha, the Enlightened One. Because the act of going for refuge to the Buddha marks the beginning of a new chapter in our life, it is worth our while to repeatedly pause and reflect upon the significance of this momentous step. Too often we are prone to take our first steps for granted. Yet it is only if we review these steps from time to time in a deepening awareness of their implications that we can be sure the following steps we take will bring us closer to our desired destination.

     - 踏上佛教之道的第一步，乃是歸依三寶，而我們前往歸依的三寶之首，即是佛陀，覺悟者。由於歸依佛陀之舉標誌著生命新一章的開啓，它值得我們反覆地靜下來觀想這一重大步驟的意義。我們太傾向於想當然地看待自己的起步。只有以漸進的理解，時時回顧這些足跡的意涵，我們才能夠確保後繼的步程將帶領我們趨近欲達之終點。

   * - The going for refuge to the Buddha is not a single action which occurs only once and is then completed with absolute finality. It is, or should be, a continually evolving process which matures in tandem with our practice and understanding of the Dhamma. To go for refuge does not imply that at the outset we already possess a clear grasp of the dangers that make a refuge necessary or of the goal toward which we aspire. Comprehension of these matters grows gradually over time. But to the extent that we have actually gone for refuge with sincere intent, we should make an earnest effort to sharpen and deepen our understanding of the objects to which we have turned as the basis for our deliverance.

     - 歸依佛陀並非是一次性徹底完成的單一事件。它是，或者說應該是一個隨著我們對佛法的修持與領悟的成熟而連續進化的過程。歸依並不意味著我們對使歸依成爲必要的危險或者對期望達到的目標一開始就有了明確的領悟。對這些事的理解與時俱增。不過，我們應當作出相應於歸依之誠意的認真努力，對自己視爲解脫之根本依靠的對象，獲得明確與深入的了解。

   * - In going for refuge to the Buddha it is most essential at the outset to clarify our conception of what a Buddha is and how he functions as a refuge. If such clarification is lacking, our sense of refuge can easily become tainted by erroneous views. We may ascribe to the Buddha a status he never claimed for himself, as when we regard him as the incarnation of a god, as the emanation of the Absolute, or as a personal savior. On the other hand, we may detract from the exalted status to which the Buddha is properly entitled, as when we regard him simply as a benevolent sage, as an unusually astute Asiatic philosopher, or as a genius of meditative technology.

     - 在歸依佛陀的初端，從概念上澄清何爲佛陀、他如何起歸依的作用，是極其重要的。缺乏這樣的澄清，我們的歸依感很容易沾染妄見。我們也許會賦予佛陀某種他自己從未承認的位格，比如把他視爲一尊神祗的化身、絕對終極的體現、或者一位個人的救主。另一方面，我們也許會對佛陀正當擁有的崇高地位加以貶低，比如把他僅僅視爲一位慈藹的智者、一位異常敏銳的亞洲哲學家、或者一位掌握禪定技術的天才。

   * - A correct view of the Buddha's nature would see him in terms of the title he assigned to himself: as a Fully Self-Enlightened One *(samma sambuddha)*. He is self-enlightened because he has awakened to the essential truths of existence entirely on his own, without a teacher or guide. He is fully enlightened because he has comprehended these truths completely, in all their ramifications and implications. And as a Buddha he has not only fathomed these truths himself, but has also taught them to the world so that others may awaken from the long sleep of ignorance and attain the fruits of liberation.

     - 對於佛陀本質的正確見解，乃是以他本人賦予自己的名號來看待他: 一位正自覺者 (*samma sambuddha*, 徹底自我覺醒者)。之所以稱他爲自覺者，是因爲他對生存的基本真相的覺醒，無師尊、嚮導，全憑自力成就。之所以稱他爲正自覺者，是因爲他對這些真相的一切細節與寓意，已達成全知。作爲一位佛陀，他不僅本人領悟了這些真相，而且還把它們傳給了世界，使得他人也有可能從無明的長眠中醒過來，證得解脫之果。

   * - Taking refuge in the Buddha is an act anchored in a particular historical individual: the recluse Gotama, the scion of the Sakyan clan, who lived and taught in the Ganges valley in the fifth century B.C. When we take refuge in the Buddha, we rely upon this historical individual and the body of instruction that stems from him. It is important to stress this point in view of the fashionable notion that taking refuge in the Buddha means that we take refuge in "the Buddha-mind within ourselves" or in "the universal principle of enlightenment." Such ideas, allowed to go unchecked, can lead to the belief that anything we contrive in the flights of our imagination can qualify as true Dhamma. To the contrary, the Buddhist tradition insists that when we go for refuge to the Buddha, we place ourselves under the guidance of one who is distinctly different from ourselves, one who has scaled heights that we have barely begun to glimpse.

     - 歸依佛陀，指的是對一位特定歷史人物的歸依: 即隱者喬達摩，生活於公元前五世紀、傳法於恒河流域的釋迦族太子。我們歸依這位佛陀時，是在歸依這位歷史人物與他的教誡。面對現今流行的歸依觀念——所謂歸依佛陀意味著歸依“我們自己內在的佛性”或者“開悟之普遍原則” ——強調這一點是十分重要的。聽任那些想法自由發展，可以引向但凡想像力馳騁所及皆可作爲真法的地步。與之相反，佛教傳統堅持認爲，當我們歸依佛陀時，是在把自己置於那位卓然獨立者的指導之下，他所成就的高度我們只開始獲得遙遙的一瞥。
