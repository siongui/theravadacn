   * - I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Gaya, at Gaya Head, with 1,000 monks. There he addressed the monks:
     - 如是我聞，一時薄伽梵與一千名比丘住在伽耶國的伽耶頭。在那裡，他對比丘們說:

   * - "Monks, the All is aflame. What All is aflame? The eye is aflame. Forms are aflame. Consciousness at the eye is aflame. Contact at the eye is aflame. And whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the eye — experienced as pleasure, pain or neither-pleasure-nor-pain — that too is aflame. Aflame with what? Aflame with the fire of passion, the fire of aversion, the fire of delusion. Aflame, I tell you, with birth, aging & death, with sorrows, lamentations, pains, distresses, & despairs.

     - “比丘們，這一切在燃燒。哪一切在燃燒? 眼在燃燒。形色在燃燒。眼識在燃燒。眼觸在燃燒。凡依賴於眼觸而昇起者——樂、痛、不樂不痛之體驗——也在燃燒。燃起爲何? 燃起了欲望之火、嗔意之火、與癡迷之火。我告訴你們，燃起了生、老、死，燃起了憂、哀、痛、悲、慘。

   * - "The ear is aflame. Sounds are aflame...
     - “耳在燃燒。聲音在燃燒……

   * - "The nose is aflame. Aromas are aflame...
     - “鼻在燃燒。氣息在燃燒……

   * - "The tongue is aflame. Flavors are aflame...
     - “舌在燃燒。味感在燃燒……

   * - "The body is aflame. Tactile sensations are aflame...
     - “身在燃燒。觸感在燃燒……

   * - "The intellect is aflame. Ideas are aflame. Consciousness at the intellect is aflame. Contact at the intellect is aflame. And whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the intellect — experienced as pleasure, pain or neither-pleasure-nor-pain — that too is aflame. Aflame with what? Aflame with the fire of passion, the fire of aversion, the fire of delusion. Aflame, I say, with birth, aging & death, with sorrows, lamentations, pains, distresses, & despairs.

     - “心在燃燒。觀念在燃燒。意識在燃燒。意觸在燃燒。凡依賴於意識接觸而昇起者——樂、痛、不樂不痛之體驗——也在燃燒。燃起爲何? 燃起了欲望之火、嗔意之火、與癡迷之火。我告訴你們，燃起了生、老、死，燃起了憂、哀、痛、悲、慘。

   * - "Seeing thus, the well-instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with the eye, disenchanted with forms, disenchanted with consciousness at the eye, disenchanted with contact at the eye. And whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the eye, experienced as pleasure, pain or neither-pleasure-nor-pain: With that, too, he grows disenchanted.

     - “如此觀之，一位聖者的多聞弟子便疏離[厭離,不再熱衷於]眼、疏離形色、疏離眼識、疏離眼觸。凡依賴於眼觸昇起的樂、痛、不樂不痛之體驗: 他隨之也疏離了。

   * - "He grows disenchanted with the ear...
     - “他疏離耳……

   * - "He grows disenchanted with the nose...
     - “他疏離鼻……

   * - "He grows disenchanted with the tongue...
     - “他疏離舌……

   * - "He grows disenchanted with the body...
     - “他疏離身……

   * - "He grows disenchanted with the intellect, disenchanted with ideas, disenchanted with consciousness at the intellect, disenchanted with contact at the intellect. And whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the intellect, experienced as pleasure, pain or neither-pleasure-nor-pain: He grows disenchanted with that too. Disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion, he is fully released. With full release, there is the knowledge, 'Fully released.' He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.'"

     - “他疏離思維、疏離觀念、疏離意識、疏離意觸。凡依賴於意識接觸而昇起的樂、痛、不樂不痛之體驗: 他隨之也疏離了。疏離了，他達到無欲。由無欲，他徹底解脫。隨著徹底解脫，他知道:‘徹底解脫了。’他有明辨:‘輪迴已終止。梵行已圓滿。任務已完成。不再有爲於世。’”

   * - That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the monks delighted at his words. And while this explanation was being given, the hearts of the 1,000 monks, through no clinging (not being sustained), were fully released from fermentation/effluents.

     - 那就是薄伽梵所言。比丘們對他的話隨喜、心悅。並且，就在這段講解進行期間，這一千位比丘的心智，由不再執取(維持)，完全解脫於漏。
