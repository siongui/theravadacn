   * - On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Kapilavatthu at the Banyan Park. Then many Sakyan lay followers, it being the Uposatha day, went to the Blessed One. On arrival, having bowed down to him, they sat to one side. As they were sitting there, the Blessed One said to them, "Sakyans, do you observe the eight-factored uposatha?"

       "Sometimes we do, lord, and sometimes we don't."

     - 一時薄伽梵住於迦毗羅衛附近的榕園。其時衆多釋迦族的居家弟子於布薩日往詣薄伽梵。近前頂禮後，坐於一邊。坐下後，薄伽梵道:“釋迦人，你們可持布薩八戒?”

       “有時持、有時不持。”

   * - "It's no gain for you, Sakyans. It's ill-gotten, that in this life so endangered by grief, in this life so endangered by death, you sometimes observe the eight-factored uposatha and sometimes don't.

     - “釋迦人啊，在這如此爲苦難威脅的人生裡，在這如此爲死亡威脅的人生裡，你們有時持布薩八戒、有時不持，對你們是無益的、是不利的。”

   * - "What do you think, Sakyans. Suppose a man, by some profession or other, without encountering an unskillful day, were to earn a half-kahapana. Would he deserve to be called a capable man, full of initiative?"

       "Yes, lord."

     - “釋迦人啊，你們以爲如何: 假定某人，憑某種專業技能，無一日不善巧，掙得半個卡哈巴那。他可值得被稱爲有主動性、有能力者?”

       “是的，世尊。”

   * - "Suppose a man, by some profession or other, without encountering an unskillful day, were to earn a kahapana... two kahapanas... three... four... five... six... seven... eight... nine... ten... twenty... thirty... forty... fifty... one hundred kahapanas. Would he deserve to be called a capable man, full of initiative?"

       "Yes, lord."

     - “假定某人，憑某種專業技能，無一日不善巧，掙得一個卡哈巴那……兩個卡哈巴那……三……四……五……六……七……八……九……十……二十……三十……四十……一百卡哈巴那。他可值得被稱爲有主動性、有能力者?”

       “是的，世尊。”

   * - "Now what do you think: earning one hundred, one thousand kahapanas a day; saving up his gains, living for one hundred years, would a man arrive at a great mass of wealth?"

       "Yes, lord."

     - “那麼，你們以爲如何: 某人日掙一百、一千卡哈巴那，積攢收入，活一百年，結果是否得到大財富?”

       “是的，世尊。”

   * - "Now what do you think: would that man, because of that wealth, on account of that wealth, with that wealth as the cause, live sensitive to unalloyed bliss for a day, a night, half a day, or half a night?"

       "No, lord. And why is that? Sensual pleasures are inconstant, hollow, false, deceptive by nature."

     - “那麼，你們以爲如何: 此人由於那筆財富、出於那筆財富、以那筆財富爲因，是否可以接連一天、或者一夜、半天、半夜，住於不息的喜樂之中?”

       “世尊，不能。爲什麼? 因爲感官之樂本質上無常、空洞、虛假、有欺騙性。”

   * - "Now, Sakyans, there is the case where a disciple of mine, spending ten years practicing as I have instructed, would live sensitive to unalloyed bliss for a hundred years, a hundred centuries, a hundred millenia. And he would be a once-returner, a non-returner, or at the very least a stream-winner.

     - “釋迦人啊，有此情形，我的一位弟子，遵照我的教導修習十年，能夠接連一百年、一百世紀、一百千年，住於不息的喜樂之中。他可以成爲一還者、不還者、或者至少成爲入流者。

   * - "Let alone ten years, there is the case where a disciple of mine, spending nine years... eight years... seven... six... five... four... three... two years... one year practicing as I have instructed, would live sensitive to unalloyed bliss for a hundred years, a hundred centuries, a hundred millenia. And he would be a once-returner, a non-returner, or at the very least a stream-winner.

     - “且不說十年，有此情形，我的一位弟子，遵照我的教導修習九年……八年……七……六……五……四……三……兩年……一年，能夠接連一百年、一百個世紀、一百個千年，住於不息的喜樂之中。他可以成爲一還者、不還者、或者至少成爲入流者。

   * - "Let alone one year, there is the case where a disciple of mine, spending ten months... nine months... eight months... seven... six... five... four... three... two months... one month... half a month practicing as I have instructed, would live sensitive to unalloyed bliss for a hundred years, a hundred centuries, a hundred millenia. And he would be a once-returner, a non-returner, or at the very least a stream-winner.

     - “且不說一年，有此情形，我的一位弟子，遵照我的教導修習十個月……九個月……八……七……六……五……四……三……兩月……一月……半月，能夠接連一百年、一百個世紀、一百個千年，住於不息的喜樂之中。他可以成爲一還者、不還者、或者至少成爲入流者。

   * - "Let alone half a month, there is the case where a disciple of mine, spending ten days & nights... nine days & nights... eight... seven... six... five... four... three... two days & nights... one day & night practicing as I have instructed, would live sensitive to unalloyed bliss for a hundred years, a hundred centuries, a hundred millenia. And he would be a once-returner, a non-returner, or at the very least a stream-winner.

     - “且不說半個月，有此情形，我的一位弟子，遵照我的教導修習十晝夜……九晝夜……八……七……六……五……四……三……兩晝夜……一晝夜，能夠接連一百年、一百個世紀、一百個千年，住於不息的喜樂之中。他可以成爲一還者、不還者、或者至少成爲入流者。

   * - "It's no gain for you, Sakyans. It's ill-gotten, that in this life so endangered by grief, in this life so endangered by death, you sometimes observe the eight-factored uposatha and sometimes don't."

     - “釋迦人啊，在這如此爲苦難威脅的人生裡，在這如此爲死亡威脅的人生裡，你們有時持布薩八戒、有時不持，對你們是無益的、是不利的。”

   * - "Then from this day forward, lord, we will observe the eight-factored uposatha."
     - “世尊，從今天起，我們將持布薩八戒。”
