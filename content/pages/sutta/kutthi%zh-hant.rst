   * - I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Rajagaha at the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Sanctuary. Now at that time in Rajagaha there was a leper named Suppabuddha, a poor, miserable wretch of a person. And at that time the Blessed One was sitting surrounded by a large assembly, teaching the Dhamma. Suppabuddha the leper saw the large gathering of people from afar and thought to himself, "Without a doubt, someone must be distributing staple or non-staple food over there. Why don't I go over to that large group of people, and maybe I'll get some staple or non-staple food." So he went over to the large group of people. Then he saw the Blessed One sitting surrounded by a large assembly, teaching the Dhamma. On seeing this, he realized, "There's no one distributing staple or non-staple food over here. That's Gotama the contemplative, sitting surrounded by a large assembly, teaching the Dhamma. Why don't I listen to the Dhamma?" So he sat to one side right there, [thinking,] "I, too, will listen to the Dhamma."

     - 如是我聞，一時薄伽梵住王舍城竹林的松鼠園。爾時王舍城有一麻瘋病者蘇巴菩達，乃貧窮、悲慘、潦倒之人。其時薄伽梵爲衆人圍繞，正端坐說法。麻瘋病者蘇巴菩達於遠處見此衆人，心想: “無疑那裡必有人佈施主食副食。我何不去那衆人處，或者可得些主食副食。”　於是朝那群人走去。他看見薄伽梵爲衆人圍繞，正端坐說法。見此，他意識到：“這裡並沒有人布施主食副食。那是沙門喬達摩爲衆人圍繞，正端坐說法。我何不聽法？”　他當即坐於一邊，[心想]：“我也願聽法。”
