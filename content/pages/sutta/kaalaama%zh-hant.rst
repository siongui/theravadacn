   * - I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One, on a wandering tour among the Kosalans with a large community of monks, arrived at Kesaputta, a town of the Kalamas. The Kalamas of Kesaputta heard it said, "Gotama the contemplative -- the son of the Sakyans, having gone forth from the Sakyan clan -- has arrived at Kesaputta. And of that Master Gotama this fine reputation has spread: 'He is indeed a Blessed One, worthy, & rightly self-awakened, consummate in knowledge & conduct, well-gone, a knower of the cosmos, an unexcelled trainer of those persons ready to be tamed, teacher of human & divine beings, awakened, blessed. He has made known -- having realized it through direct knowledge -- this world with its devas, maras, & brahmas, its generations with their contemplatives & priests, their rulers & common people; has explained the Dhamma admirable in the beginning, admirable in the middle, admirable in the end; has expounded the holy life both in its particulars & in its essence, entirely perfect, surpassingly pure. It is good to see such a worthy one.'"

     - 如是我聞，一時薄伽梵與一大群比丘在拘薩羅國游方，來到卡拉瑪(伽藍磨)人居住的克薩普達(羇舍子)城。克薩普達的卡拉瑪人聽聞:“沙門喬達摩——從釋迦族出家的釋迦之子——已來到克薩普達。關於喬達摩大師，流傳著這樣的好名聲。‘他確是一位阿羅漢、正自覺者、明行足、善逝者、世間解、無上調御者、人天之師、佛陀、薄伽梵。他親證了法，之後在這個有天神、魔羅、梵天、行者僧侶與王者平民的世界上宣講;他解說的法義，始善、中善、後善; 他講述的梵行，在細節與要義上，圓滿具足、清淨非凡。見這樣一位阿羅漢是件善事。’”
