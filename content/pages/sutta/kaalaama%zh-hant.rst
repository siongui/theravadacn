   * - I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One, on a wandering tour among the Kosalans with a large community of monks, arrived at Kesaputta, a town of the Kalamas. The Kalamas of Kesaputta heard it said, "Gotama the contemplative -- the son of the Sakyans, having gone forth from the Sakyan clan -- has arrived at Kesaputta. And of that Master Gotama this fine reputation has spread: 'He is indeed a Blessed One, worthy, & rightly self-awakened, consummate in knowledge & conduct, well-gone, a knower of the cosmos, an unexcelled trainer of those persons ready to be tamed, teacher of human & divine beings, awakened, blessed. He has made known -- having realized it through direct knowledge -- this world with its devas, maras, & brahmas, its generations with their contemplatives & priests, their rulers & common people; has explained the Dhamma admirable in the beginning, admirable in the middle, admirable in the end; has expounded the holy life both in its particulars & in its essence, entirely perfect, surpassingly pure. It is good to see such a worthy one.'"

     - 如是我聞，一時薄伽梵與一大群比丘在拘薩羅國游方，來到卡拉瑪(伽藍磨)人居住的克薩普達(羇舍子)城。克薩普達的卡拉瑪人聽聞:“沙門喬達摩——從釋迦族出家的釋迦之子——已來到克薩普達。關於喬達摩大師，流傳著這樣的好名聲。‘他確是一位阿羅漢、正自覺者、明行足、善逝者、世間解、無上調御者、人天之師、佛陀、薄伽梵。他親證了法，之後在這個有天神、魔羅、梵天、行者僧侶與王者平民的世界上宣講;他解說的法義，始善、中善、後善; 他講述的梵行，在細節與要義上，圓滿具足、清淨非凡。見這樣一位阿羅漢是件善事。’”

   * - So the Kalamas of Kesaputta went to the Blessed One. On arrival, some of them bowed down to him and sat to one side. Some of them exchanged courteous greetings with him and, after an exchange of friendly greetings & courtesies, sat to one side. Some of them sat to one side having saluted him with their hands palm-to-palm over their hearts. Some of them sat to one side having announced their name & clan. Some of them sat to one side in silence.

     - 於是卡拉瑪人去見薄伽梵。到達時，有的向他頂禮，在一旁坐下。有的與他相互問候，在友好的問候與禮節之後，在一旁坐下。有的合掌於胸前，朝他致意，在一旁坐下。有的自報姓名後，在一旁坐下。有的不出聲，在一旁坐下。

   * - As they sat there, the Kalamas of Kesaputta said to the Blessed One, "Lord, there are some priests & contemplatives who come to Kesaputta. They expound & glorify their own doctrines, but as for the doctrines of others, they deprecate them, revile them, show contempt for them, & disparage them. And then other priests & contemplatives come to Kesaputta. They expound & glorify their own doctrines, but as for the doctrines of others, they deprecate them, revile them, show contempt for them, & disparage them. They leave us absolutely uncertain & in doubt: Which of these venerable priests & contemplatives are speaking the truth, and which ones are lying?"

     - 他們在一旁坐著時，克薩普達的卡拉碼人對薄伽梵說: “世尊，有一些僧侶行者來到克薩普達。他們闡述、頌揚自己的教義，但是對於他人的教義，則貶低、辱罵、鄙視、毀謗。接著，又有其他僧侶行者來到克薩普達。他們闡述、頌揚自己的教義，但是對於他人的教義，則貶低、辱罵、鄙視、毀謗。他們根本讓我們疑惑不定: 這些尊敬的僧侶行者們，哪些講真話，那些在欺騙？”

   * - "Of course you are uncertain, Kalamas. Of course you are in doubt. When there are reasons for doubt, uncertainty is born. So in this case, Kalamas, don't go by reports, by legends, by traditions, by scripture, by logical conjecture, by inference, by analogies, by agreement through pondering views, by probability, or by the thought, 'This contemplative is our teacher.' When you know for yourselves that, 'These qualities are unskillful; these qualities are blameworthy; these qualities are criticized by the wise; these qualities, when adopted & carried out, lead to harm & to suffering' -- then you should abandon them.

     - “卡拉瑪人，你們當然不確定。你們當然有疑惑。當有某些原因使你們疑惑、不確定，就像這個情形時，卡拉瑪人，不要只聽從報道、傳聞、傳統、經典、猜測、推論、類比、同感、可能性、或者‘這位行者是我們的老師’的想法。當你親自了解了，‘這些素質是缺乏技巧的；這些素質是該受責備的；這些素質受智者的批評；這些素質採納施行起來，趨向傷害與苦痛’——那時你應當棄絕它們。”

   * - "What do you think, Kalamas? When greed arises in a person, does it arise for welfare or for harm?"

       "For harm, lord."

       "And this greedy person, overcome by greed, his mind possessed by greed, kills living beings, takes what is not given, goes after another person's wife, tells lies, and induces others to do likewise, all of which is for long-term harm & suffering."

       "Yes, lord."

     - “卡拉瑪人，你們認爲如何，當一個人升起貪欲時，是有益還是有害？”

       “世尊，是有害。”

       “這個貪人，爲貪意左右，心受貪意控制: 他殺生、不予而取、追逐他人之妻、說謊並誘使他人效仿，這一切皆有長遠的傷害與苦痛。”

       “正是，世尊。”

   * - "Now, what do you think, Kalamas? When aversion arises in a person, does it arise for welfare or for harm?"

       "For harm, lord."

       "And this aversive person, overcome by aversion, his mind possessed by aversion, kills living beings, takes what is not given, goes after another person's wife, tells lies, and induces others to do likewise, all of which is for long-term harm & suffering."

       "Yes, lord."

     - “卡拉瑪人，你們認爲如何，當一個人升起瞋怒時，是有益還是有害？”

       “世尊，是有害。”

       “這個瞋人，爲瞋意左右，心受瞋意控制: 他殺生、不予而取、追逐他人之妻、說謊並誘使他人效仿，這一切皆有長遠的傷害與苦痛。”

       “正是，世尊。”

   * - "Now, what do you think, Kalamas? When delusion arises in a person, does it arise for welfare or for harm?"

       "For harm, lord."

       "And this deluded person, overcome by delusion, his mind possessed by delusion, kills living beings, takes what is not given, goes after another person's wife, tells lies, and induces others to do likewise, all of which is for long-term harm & suffering."

       "Yes, lord."

     - “卡拉瑪人，你們認爲如何，當一個人升起癡迷時，是有益還是有害？”

       “世尊，是有害。”

       “這個癡人，爲癡意左右，心受癡意控制: 他殺生、不予而取、追逐他人之妻、說謊並誘使他人效仿，這一切皆有長遠的傷害與苦痛。”

       “正是，世尊。”

   * - "So what do you think, Kalamas: Are these qualities skillful or unskillful?"

       "Unskillful, lord."

       "Blameworthy or blameless?"

       "Blameworthy, lord."

       "Criticized by the wise or praised by the wise?"

       "Criticized by the wise, lord."

       "When adopted & carried out, do they lead to harm & to suffering, or not?"

       "When adopted & carried out, they lead to harm & to suffering. That is how it appears to us."

     - “那麼，卡拉瑪人：這些素質是善巧還是缺乏善巧？”

       “世尊，它們缺乏善巧”

       “是該受責備，還是無可責備？”

       “世尊，它們該受責備。”

       “是受智者批評還是讚揚？”

       “世尊，它們受智者的批評。”

       “採納施行起來，是否趨向傷害與苦痛？”

       “世尊，它們採納施行起來，趨向傷害與苦痛。”

   * - "So, as I said, Kalamas: 'Don't go by reports, by legends, by traditions, by scripture, by logical conjecture, by inference, by analogies, by agreement through pondering views, by probability, or by the thought, "This contemplative is our teacher." When you know for yourselves that, "These qualities are unskillful; these qualities are blameworthy; these qualities are criticized by the wise; these qualities, when adopted & carried out, lead to harm & to suffering" -- then you should abandon them.' Thus was it said. And in reference to this was it said.

     - “因此，卡拉瑪人，我說過，‘不要只聽從報道，傳聞、傳統、經典、猜測、推論、類比、同感、可能性、或者“這位行者是我們的老師”的想法。當你親自了解了，“這些素質是缺乏技巧的；這些素質是該受責備的；這些素質受智者的批評；這些素質採納施行起來，趨向傷害與苦痛”——那時你應當棄絕它們。’是這樣說的. 是指這方面而說。’

   * - "Now, Kalamas, don't go by reports, by legends, by traditions, by scripture, by logical conjecture, by inference, by analogies, by agreement through pondering views, by probability, or by the thought, 'This contemplative is our teacher.' When you know for yourselves that, 'These qualities are skillful; these qualities are blameless; these qualities are praised by the wise; these qualities, when adopted & carried out, lead to welfare & to happiness' -- then you should enter & remain in them.

     - “再者，卡拉瑪人，不要只聽從報道、傳聞、傳統、經典、猜測、推論、類比、同感、可能性、或者‘這位行者是我們的老師’的想法。當你親自了解了，‘這些素質是善巧的；這些素質是無可責備的；這些素質受智者的讚揚；這些素質採納奉行起來，趨向安寧與幸福’——那時你應當進入、安住其中。

   * - "What do you think, Kalamas? When lack of greed arises in a person, does it arise for welfare or for harm?"

       "For welfare, lord."

       "And this ungreedy person, not overcome by greed, his mind not possessed by greed, doesn't kill living beings, take what is not given, go after another person's wife, tell lies, or induce others to do likewise, all of which is for long-term welfare & happiness."

       "Yes, lord."

     - “卡拉瑪人，你們認爲如何，當一個人升起離貪之意時，是有益還是有害？”

       “世尊，是有益。”

       “這個離貪之人，不爲貪意左右，他的心不受貪意控制: 他戒殺生、不予而取、追逐他人之妻、說謊並誘使他人效仿，這一切皆有長遠的安寧與幸福。”

       “正是，世尊。”

   * - "What do you think, Kalamas? When lack of aversion arises in a person, does it arise for welfare or for harm?"

       "For welfare, lord."

       "And this unaversive person, not overcome by aversion, his mind not possessed by aversion, doesn't kill living beings, take what is not given, go after another person's wife, tell lies, or induce others to do likewise, all of which is for long-term welfare & happiness."

       "Yes, lord."

     - “卡拉瑪人，你們認爲如何，當一個人升起離瞋之意時，是有益還是有害？”

       “世尊，是有益。”

       “這個離瞋之人，不爲瞋意左右，他的心不受瞋意控制: 他戒殺生、不予而取、追逐他人之妻、說謊並誘使他人效仿，這一切皆有長遠的安寧與幸福。”

       “正是，世尊。”

   * - "What do you think, Kalamas? When lack of delusion arises in a person, does it arise for welfare or for harm?"

       "For welfare, lord."

       "And this undeluded person, not overcome by delusion, his mind not possessed by delusion, doesn't kill living beings, take what is not given, go after another person's wife, tell lies, or induce others to do likewise, all of which is for long-term welfare & happiness."

       "Yes, lord."

     - “卡拉瑪人，你們認爲如何，當一個人升起離癡之意時，是有益還是有害？”

       “世尊，是有益。”

       “這個離癡之人，不爲癡意左右，他的心不受癡意控制: 他戒殺生、不予而取、追逐他人之妻、說謊並誘使他人效仿，這一切皆有長遠的安寧與幸福。”

       “正是，世尊。”
