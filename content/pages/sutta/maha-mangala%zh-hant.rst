   * - I have heard that at one time the Blessed One was staying in Savatthi at Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's monastery. Then a certain deva, in the far extreme of the night, her extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jeta's Grove, approached the Blessed One. On approaching, having bowed down to the Blessed One, she stood to one side. As she stood to one side, she addressed him with a verse.

     - 如是我聞，一時薄伽梵住舍衛城祇樹給孤獨精舍。有一天神，於深夜時分，身放強光、遍照祇樹，走近薄伽梵。走近跟前，向薄伽梵頂禮後，立於一邊。立於一邊後，她向薄伽梵口說一偈:
