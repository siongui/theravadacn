   * - I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Varanasi in the Game Refuge at Isipatana. There he addressed the group of five monks:
     - [如是我聞]，一時薄伽梵住波羅那斯仙人墜的鹿野苑。在那裡，薄伽梵對五衆比丘說：

   * - "There are these two extremes that are not to be indulged in by one who has gone forth. Which two? That which is devoted to sensual pleasure with reference to sensual objects: base, vulgar, common, ignoble, unprofitable; and that which is devoted to self-affliction: painful, ignoble, unprofitable. Avoiding both of these extremes, the middle way realized by the Tathagata — producing vision, producing knowledge — leads to calm, to direct knowledge, to self-awakening, to Unbinding.

     - "比丘們，有此兩極端，隱者[出家者]不可耽於其中——哪兩極? 於感官對象，追求感官之樂：是低級、粗鄙、庸俗、非聖、無益的; 追求自虐：是痛苦、非聖、無益的。比丘們，避此兩極端，如來實現的中道——引生見、引生知——趨向寧靜、直覺智、自覺醒、涅槃。

   * - **[The Noble Eightfold Path]**

       "And what is the middle way realized by the Tathagata that — producing vision, producing knowledge — leads to calm, to direct knowledge, to self-awakening, to Unbinding? Precisely this Noble Eightfold Path: right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration. This is the middle way realized by the Tathagata that — producing vision, producing knowledge — leads to calm, to direct knowledge, to self-awakening, to Unbinding.

     - [八聖道]

       比丘們，如來實現的中道——引生見、引生知，趨向寧靜、直覺智、自覺醒、涅槃者——是什麽？正是此八聖道：正見、正志、正語、正業、正命、正精進、正念、正定。比丘們，此爲如來實現的中道——引生見、引生知，趨向寧靜、直覺智、自覺醒、涅槃。

   * - **[The Four Noble Truths]**

          <span id="4nt"></span>

       "Now this, monks, is the noble truth of stress: Birth is stressful, aging is stressful, death is stressful; sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, & despair are stressful; association with the unbeloved is stressful, separation from the loved is stressful, not getting what is wanted is stressful. In short, the five clinging-aggregates are stressful.

     - [四聖諦]

       比丘們，此爲苦聖諦：生苦、老苦、死苦；憂、哀、痛、悲、慘苦；與不愛者共處苦、與愛者離別苦、所求不得苦：簡言之，五取蘊苦。

   * - "And this, monks, is the noble truth of the origination of stress: the craving that makes for further becoming — accompanied by passion & delight, relishing now here & now there — i.e., craving for sensual pleasure, craving for becoming, craving for non-becoming.

     - 比丘們, 此爲苦因聖諦：\ :small:`[苦因是:]`\ 造作再生的渴求——帶著貪與喜、於處處耽享——正是: 對感官之欲的渴求、對有生的渴求、對無生的渴求。

   * - "And this, monks, is the noble truth of the cessation of stress: the remainderless fading & cessation, renunciation, relinquishment, release, & letting go of that very craving.

     - 比丘們，此爲苦的止息聖諦：對該渴求的無餘離貪、止息、捨離、棄絕、解脫、放開。

   * - "And this, monks, is the noble truth of the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress: precisely this Noble Eightfold Path — right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.

     - 比丘們，此爲趨向止息苦之道聖諦：正是此八聖道——正見、正志、正語、正業、正命、正精進、正念、正定。

   * - **[One's duties with regard to the Four Noble Truths]**

       "Vision arose, insight arose, discernment arose, knowledge arose, illumination arose within me with regard to things never heard before: 'This is the noble truth of stress'... 'This noble truth of stress is to be comprehended'... 'This noble truth of stress has been comprehended.'

     - .. _responsibility:

       [對於四聖諦的責任]

       比丘們，我對前所未聞之法，升起視眼、升起洞見、升起明辨、升起知識、升起光明\ :small:`[眼生智生慧生明生光生]`\ ：‘此爲苦聖諦’。……‘此苦聖諦需全知’……‘此苦聖諦已全知’。
