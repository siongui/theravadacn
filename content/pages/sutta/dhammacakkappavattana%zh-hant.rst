   * - I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Varanasi in the Game Refuge at Isipatana. There he addressed the group of five monks:
     - [如是我聞]，一時薄伽梵住波羅那斯仙人墜的鹿野苑。在那裡，薄伽梵對五衆比丘說：

   * - "There are these two extremes that are not to be indulged in by one who has gone forth. Which two? That which is devoted to sensual pleasure with reference to sensual objects: base, vulgar, common, ignoble, unprofitable; and that which is devoted to self-affliction: painful, ignoble, unprofitable. Avoiding both of these extremes, the middle way realized by the Tathagata — producing vision, producing knowledge — leads to calm, to direct knowledge, to self-awakening, to Unbinding.

     - "比丘們，有此兩極端，隱者[出家者]不可耽於其中——哪兩極? 於感官對象，追求感官之樂：是低級、粗鄙、庸俗、非聖、無益的; 追求自虐：是痛苦、非聖、無益的。比丘們，避此兩極端，如來實現的中道——引生見、引生知——趨向寧靜、直覺智、自覺醒、涅槃。

   * - **[The Noble Eightfold Path]**

       "And what is the middle way realized by the Tathagata that — producing vision, producing knowledge — leads to calm, to direct knowledge, to self-awakening, to Unbinding? Precisely this Noble Eightfold Path: right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration. This is the middle way realized by the Tathagata that — producing vision, producing knowledge — leads to calm, to direct knowledge, to self-awakening, to Unbinding.

     - [八聖道]

       比丘們，如來實現的中道——引生見、引生知，趨向寧靜、直覺智、自覺醒、涅槃者——是什麽？正是此八聖道：正見、正志、正語、正業、正命、正精進、正念、正定。比丘們，此爲如來實現的中道——引生見、引生知，趨向寧靜、直覺智、自覺醒、涅槃。

   * - **[The Four Noble Truths]**

       "Now this, monks, is the noble truth of stress: Birth is stressful, aging is stressful, death is stressful; sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, & despair are stressful; association with the unbeloved is stressful, separation from the loved is stressful, not getting what is wanted is stressful. In short, the five clinging-aggregates are stressful.

     - [四聖諦]

       比丘們，此爲苦聖諦：生苦、老苦、死苦；憂、哀、痛、悲、慘苦；與不愛者共處苦、與愛者離別苦、所求不得苦：簡言之，五取蘊苦。
