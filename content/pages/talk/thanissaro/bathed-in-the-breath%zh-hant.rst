   * - When there’s a Dhamma talk, you don’t have to listen. The important thing is to stay with your breath. When the breath comes in, you know it’s coming in; when it goes out, you know it’s going out. Try to make that experience of the breath fill your awareness as much as possible. The Dhamma talk here is a fence to keep you corralled with the breath. When the mind wanders off, here’s the sound of the Dhamma to remind you to go back to the breath, but when you’re with the breath you don’t need reminding. You do your own reminding. That’s what the mindfulness does in the meditation. Each time you breathe in, each time you breathe out, remind yourself to stay with the breath. Make just a little mental note: “This is where you want to stay, this is where you want to stay.”

     - 有開示時，你不一定要聆聽。重要的是，跟你的氣待在一起。氣入時，你知道它在入內; 氣出時，你知道它在外出。試著盡量使那股氣的體驗填滿你的覺知。這裡的開示，是把你和氣攏在一起的圈欄。心遊蕩出去時，有法音在這裡提醒你返回到氣; 不過當你跟氣住在一起時，就不需要提醒了。你自己提醒自己。那就是念在禪定中的作用。每一次吸氣，每一次呼氣，提醒自己與氣待在一起。作一個小小的心理標記: “這是你要待的地方，這是你要待的地方。”

   * - And try not to think of yourself as inhabiting one part of the body watching the breath in another part of the body. Think of the breath as all around you. It’s coming in and out the front, coming in and out the back, down from the top, all the way out to your fingers, all the way out to your toes. There’s a subtle breath energy coming in and out of the body all the time. If you’re in one part of the body watching the breath in the other part, you’re probably blocking the breath energy to make space for that sense of “you” in the part of the body that’s watching. So think of yourself as totally surrounded by the breath, bathed in the breath, and then survey the whole body to see where there are still sections of the body that are tense or tight, that are preventing the breath from coming in and going out. Allow them to loosen up.

     - 試著不把自己想像成居於身體的某處，觀察身體的另一處。把氣想像成四面八方圍繞著你。它在你的身前進出，在你的背上進出，從頭頂往下走，一直到從你的手指外出，一直到從你的腳趾外出。有一股精細的氣能，一直在進出身體。如果你位於身體的某一處，觀察另一處的氣，就有可能為了造就處在觀察部位的那個“你”感，而阻礙了氣能。因此，把自己想成整個被氣所包圍，沐浴在氣中，接著，審視全身，看還有哪些身體節段仍然感到蹦緊、勒緊，仍然阻礙著氣的出入。讓它們鬆開。

   * - This way you allow for the fullness of the breath to come in, go out, each time there’s an in-breath, each time there’s an out-breath. Actually the fullness doesn’t go in and out. There’s just a quality of fullness that’s bathed by the breath coming in, bathed by the breath going out. It’s not squeezed out by the breath. It’s not forced out by the breath. Each nerve in the body is allowed to relax and have a sense of fullness, right here, right now. Simply try to maintain that sense of fullness by the way you breathe. Your focus is on the breath, but you can’t help but notice the fullness.

     - 這樣，每一次入氣，每一次出氣，你都讓氣的那股充沛性進來、出去。實際上，不是充沛性在進出，只是有一種充沛的素質，被入氣所沐浴，被出氣所沐浴。它不被氣擠出。它不被氣趕出。體內的每根經絡，此地此刻，都被允許放鬆，都有一股充沛感。你只要藉著調節呼吸，試著維持那股充沛感。你把注意力放在氣上，不過你不可能不注意到那股充沛。

   * - If you can’t get that sense of fullness going throughout the whole body, find at least some part of the body that doesn’t feel squeezed out, that feels open and expansive, and then see if you can copy that same feeling tone in other parts of the body. Notice the other different parts of the body where it feels open like that and allow them to connect. At first, nothing much will happen from that sense of connection, but allow it to stay open, stay open. Each time you breathe in, each time you breathe out, maintain that sense of openness, openness, and the sense of connection will get stronger.

     - 如果你不能夠使那股充沛感到達全身，起碼要找到某個身體部位，在那裡你不感到擠壓，而是感到開通、擴展，接下來，看看你能不能把同樣的覺受基調，複製到身體的其它部位。注意觀察別處有同樣開通感的部位，讓它們連通起來。一開始，從那股連通感當中，不會發生很多事，不過要允許它繼續開著、繼續開著。每一次吸氣，每一次呼氣，都要維持那股開通、開通的感覺，連通感就會增強起來。

   * - This is why the ability to stay with these sensations is so important, for your staying with them is what allows them to grow. If you move off to someplace else, if you’re thinking of something else, there will have to be a tensing-up in the body to allow that thought to happen. Whatever sense of fullness might have developed—say, in your arms or your legs, in different parts of the body, down your back—doesn’t have a chance to develop. It gets squeezed off because you’re not paying attention to it any more.

     - 這就是為什麼，與這些覺受待在一起的能力如此重要，因為正是你跟它們待在一起，才是讓它們增長的原因。如果你挪到了別處，如果你去想其它事，體內必須有一種緊繃，才能那個想法發生。不管已經發展出什麼充沛感——比如在你的胳膊或腿內，在身體的不同部位，沿背而下——就沒有繼續發展的機緣了。它給擠縮了，因為你對它不再關注。
