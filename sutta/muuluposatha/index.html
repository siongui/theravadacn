<tr><td><p class="first">I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Savatthi at the Eastern Monastery, the palace of Migara's mother. Now at that time — it being the Uposatha day — Visakha, Migara's mother, went to the Blessed One in the middle of the day and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As she was sitting there the Blessed One said to her, &quot;Well now, Visakha, why are you coming in the middle of the day?&quot;</p>
<p class="last">&quot;Today I am observing the Uposatha, lord.&quot;</p>
</td>
<td><p class="first">如是我聞: 一時薄伽梵住在舍衛城附近的東寺彌訶羅母堂 <a class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1">[1]</a> 。其時爲布薩日，彌訶羅之母毗沙卡於日中往詣薄伽梵，近前頂禮後坐於一邊。坐下後，薄伽梵對她說:“毗沙卡，你何以日中前來?”</p>
<p class="last">“世尊，我今日持守布薩。”</p>

<tr><td>&quot;Visakha, there are these three Uposathas. Which three? The Uposatha of a cowherd, the Uposatha of the Jains, and the Uposatha of the Noble Ones.</td>
<td>“毗沙卡，有這三種布薩。哪三種? 有牛倌的布薩、有耆那的布薩、有聖者的布薩。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>&quot;And what is the Uposatha of a cowherd? Just as when a cowherd returns the cattle to their owners in the evening, he reflects: 'Today the cattle wandered to that spot and this, drank at this spot and that; tomorrow they will wander to that spot and this, will drink at this spot and that'; in the same way, there is the case where a certain person observing the Uposatha reflects, 'Today I ate this sort of non-staple food and that sort of staple food. Tomorrow I will eat that sort of non-staple food and this sort of staple food.' He spends the day with an awareness imbued with that covetousness, with that greed. Such is the Uposatha of a cowherd, Visakha. When this Uposatha of a cowherd is undertaken, it is not of great fruit or great benefit, not of great glory or great radiance.</td>
<td>“何爲牛倌的布薩? 正如牛倌夜晚把牛群趕回主人家時，他想:‘今日牛群在那處、這處遊蕩，在這處、那處飲水; 明日它們將在那處、這處遊蕩，在這處、那處飲水。'同樣地，有此情形，某人修持布薩時想:‘今日我吃了這類副食、那類主食。明日我將吃那類副食、這類主食。'覺知爲該覬覦所浸染、爲該貪婪所浸染，他度過了那一日。毗沙卡，牛倌的布薩即是如此。持守這等牛倌的布薩，是無大果報、大利益，無大榮耀、大光明的。</td>

<tr><td><p class="first">&quot;And what is the Uposatha of the Jains? There are the contemplatives called the Niganthas (Jains). They get their disciple to undertake the following practice: 'Here, my good man. Lay down the rod with regard to beings who live more than 100 leagues to the east... more than 100 leagues to the west... more than 100 leagues to the north... more than 100 leagues to the south.' Thus they get the disciple to undertake kindness &amp; sympathy to some beings, but not to others.</p>
<p class="last">&quot;On the Uposatha day, they get their disciple to undertake the following practice: 'Here, my good man. Having stripped off all your clothing, say this: &quot;I am nothing by anything or of anything. Thus there is nothing by anything or of anything that is mine.&quot;' Yet in spite of that, his parents know of him that 'This is our child.' And he knows of them that 'These are my parents.' His wives &amp; children know of him that 'This is our husband &amp; father.' And he knows of them that 'These are my wives &amp; children.' His workers &amp; slaves know of him that 'This is our master.' And he knows of them that 'These are my workers &amp; slaves.' Thus at a time when he should be persuaded to undertake truthfulness, he is persuaded to undertake falsehood. At the end of the night, he resumes the consumption of his belongings, even though they aren't given back to him. This counts as stealing, I tell you. Such is the Uposatha of the Jains, Visakha. When this Uposatha of the Jains is undertaken, it is not of great fruit or great benefit, not of great glory or great radiance.</p>
</td>
<td><p class="first">“那麼，何爲耆那的布薩? 有稱爲尼乾子的沙門(指耆那教徒)。他們命弟子如此修持:‘如此，善男子。對居於東面一百多里的有情放下棍杖……對居於西面一百多里的有情……對居於北面一百多里的有情……對居於南面一百多里的有情放下棍杖。'如此，他們命弟子對某些有情、但不對其他有情施以仁慈與同情。</p>
<p class="last">“布薩日時，他們命弟子如此修持:‘如此，善男子。把你的所有衣服脫去，說:“對於任何依賴或隸屬之事而言，我什麼也不是。因此沒有什麼依賴我或隸屬我。”'盡管如此，他的父母識得他:‘這是我們的孩子。'他識得他們:‘這是我的父母。'他的妻兒識得他:‘這是我們的丈夫、父親。'他識得他們:‘這是我的妻兒。'他的雇工與家奴識得他:‘這是我們的主人。'他識得他們:‘這是我的雇工與家奴。'因此，在他應被勸誡持守真語時卻被勸誡持守妄語。夜盡時，他恢復對自己所有物的享受，盡管它們並未歸還給他。我告訴你，這算偷竊。毗沙卡，耆那的布薩即是如此。持守這等耆那的布薩，是無大果報、大利益，無大榮耀、大光明的。</p>
