<tr><td>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One, on a wandering tour among the Kosalans with a large community of monks, arrived at Kesaputta, a town of the Kalamas. The Kalamas of Kesaputta heard it said, &quot;Gotama the contemplative -- the son of the Sakyans, having gone forth from the Sakyan clan -- has arrived at Kesaputta. And of that Master Gotama this fine reputation has spread: 'He is indeed a Blessed One, worthy, &amp; rightly self-awakened, consummate in knowledge &amp; conduct, well-gone, a knower of the cosmos, an unexcelled trainer of those persons ready to be tamed, teacher of human &amp; divine beings, awakened, blessed. He has made known -- having realized it through direct knowledge -- this world with its devas, maras, &amp; brahmas, its generations with their contemplatives &amp; priests, their rulers &amp; common people; has explained the Dhamma admirable in the beginning, admirable in the middle, admirable in the end; has expounded the holy life both in its particulars &amp; in its essence, entirely perfect, surpassingly pure. It is good to see such a worthy one.'&quot;</td>
<td>如是我闻，一时薄伽梵与一大群比丘在拘萨罗国游方，来到卡拉玛(伽蓝磨)人居住的克萨普达(羇舍子)城。克萨普达的卡拉玛人听闻:“沙门乔达摩——从释迦族出家的释迦之子——已来到克萨普达。关于乔达摩大师，流传著这样的好名声。‘他确是一位阿罗汉、正自觉者、明行足、善逝者、世间解、无上调御者、人天之师、佛陀、薄伽梵。他亲证了法，之后在这个有天神、魔罗、梵天、行者僧侣与王者平民的世界上宣讲;他解说的法义，始善、中善、后善; 他讲述的梵行，在细节与要义上，圆满具足、清净非凡。见这样一位阿罗汉是件善事。’”</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>So the Kalamas of Kesaputta went to the Blessed One. On arrival, some of them bowed down to him and sat to one side. Some of them exchanged courteous greetings with him and, after an exchange of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, sat to one side. Some of them sat to one side having saluted him with their hands palm-to-palm over their hearts. Some of them sat to one side having announced their name &amp; clan. Some of them sat to one side in silence.</td>
<td>于是卡拉玛人去见薄伽梵。到达时，有的向他顶礼，在一旁坐下。有的与他相互问候，在友好的问候与礼节之后，在一旁坐下。有的合掌于胸前，朝他致意，在一旁坐下。有的自报姓名后，在一旁坐下。有的不出声，在一旁坐下。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>As they sat there, the Kalamas of Kesaputta said to the Blessed One, &quot;Lord, there are some priests &amp; contemplatives who come to Kesaputta. They expound &amp; glorify their own doctrines, but as for the doctrines of others, they deprecate them, revile them, show contempt for them, &amp; disparage them. And then other priests &amp; contemplatives come to Kesaputta. They expound &amp; glorify their own doctrines, but as for the doctrines of others, they deprecate them, revile them, show contempt for them, &amp; disparage them. They leave us absolutely uncertain &amp; in doubt: Which of these venerable priests &amp; contemplatives are speaking the truth, and which ones are lying?&quot;</td>
<td>他们在一旁坐著时，克萨普达的卡拉码人对薄伽梵说: “世尊，有一些僧侣行者来到克萨普达。他们阐述、颂扬自己的教义，但是对于他人的教义，则贬低、辱骂、鄙视、毁谤。接著，又有其他僧侣行者来到克萨普达。他们阐述、颂扬自己的教义，但是对于他人的教义，则贬低、辱骂、鄙视、毁谤。他们根本让我们疑惑不定: 这些尊敬的僧侣行者们，哪些讲真话，那些在欺骗？”</td>

<tr><td>&quot;Of course you are uncertain, Kalamas. Of course you are in doubt. When there are reasons for doubt, uncertainty is born. So in this case, Kalamas, don't go by reports, by legends, by traditions, by scripture, by logical conjecture, by inference, by analogies, by agreement through pondering views, by probability, or by the thought, 'This contemplative is our teacher.' When you know for yourselves that, 'These qualities are unskillful; these qualities are blameworthy; these qualities are criticized by the wise; these qualities, when adopted &amp; carried out, lead to harm &amp; to suffering' -- then you should abandon them.</td>
<td>“卡拉玛人，你们当然不确定。你们当然有疑惑。当有某些原因使你们疑惑、不确定，就像这个情形时，卡拉玛人，不要只听从报道、传闻、传统、经典、猜测、推论、类比、同感、可能性、或者‘这位行者是我们的老师’的想法。当你亲自了解了，‘这些素质是缺乏技巧的；这些素质是该受责备的；这些素质受智者的批评；这些素质采纳施行起来，趋向伤害与苦痛’——那时你应当弃绝它们。”</td>

<tr><td>&quot;Magnificent, lord! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has the Blessed One -- through many lines of reasoning -- made the Dhamma clear. We go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of monks. May the Blessed One remember us as lay followers who have gone to him for refuge, from this day forward, for life.&quot;</td>
<td>“胜哉！世尊，胜哉！世尊正好比将颠倒之物置正、把隐秘之事揭开、为迷途者指路、在黑夜里举灯、使有目者见形，同样地，世尊藉多方推理，阐明了法。我们归依世尊、归依法、归依僧。愿世尊记得我们这些从今天起一生归依于他的居家弟子们。”</td>
