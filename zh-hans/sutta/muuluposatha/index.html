<tr><td><p class="first">I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Savatthi at the Eastern Monastery, the palace of Migara's mother. Now at that time — it being the Uposatha day — Visakha, Migara's mother, went to the Blessed One in the middle of the day and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As she was sitting there the Blessed One said to her, &quot;Well now, Visakha, why are you coming in the middle of the day?&quot;</p>
<p class="last">&quot;Today I am observing the Uposatha, lord.&quot;</p>
</td>
<td><p class="first">如是我闻: 一时薄伽梵住在舍卫城附近的东寺弥诃罗母堂 <a class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1">[1]</a> 。其时为布萨日，弥诃罗之母毗沙卡于日中往诣薄伽梵，近前顶礼后坐于一边。坐下后，薄伽梵对她说:“毗沙卡，你何以日中前来?”</p>
<p class="last">“世尊，我今日持守布萨。”</p>
</td>

<tr><td>&quot;Visakha, there are these three Uposathas. Which three? The Uposatha of a cowherd, the Uposatha of the Jains, and the Uposatha of the Noble Ones.</td>
<td>“毗沙卡，有这三种布萨。哪三种? 有牛倌的布萨、有耆那的布萨、有圣者的布萨。</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>&quot;And what is the Uposatha of a cowherd? Just as when a cowherd returns the cattle to their owners in the evening, he reflects: 'Today the cattle wandered to that spot and this, drank at this spot and that; tomorrow they will wander to that spot and this, will drink at this spot and that'; in the same way, there is the case where a certain person observing the Uposatha reflects, 'Today I ate this sort of non-staple food and that sort of staple food. Tomorrow I will eat that sort of non-staple food and this sort of staple food.' He spends the day with an awareness imbued with that covetousness, with that greed. Such is the Uposatha of a cowherd, Visakha. When this Uposatha of a cowherd is undertaken, it is not of great fruit or great benefit, not of great glory or great radiance.</td>
<td>“何为牛倌的布萨? 正如牛倌夜晚把牛群赶回主人家时，他想:‘今日牛群在那处、这处游荡，在这处、那处饮水; 明日它们将在那处、这处游荡，在这处、那处饮水。'同样地，有此情形，某人修持布萨时想:‘今日我吃了这类副食、那类主食。明日我将吃那类副食、这类主食。'觉知为该觊觎所浸染、为该贪婪所浸染，他度过了那一日。毗沙卡，牛倌的布萨即是如此。持守这等牛倌的布萨，是无大果报、大利益，无大荣耀、大光明的。</td>

<tr><td><p class="first">&quot;And what is the Uposatha of the Jains? There are the contemplatives called the Niganthas (Jains). They get their disciple to undertake the following practice: 'Here, my good man. Lay down the rod with regard to beings who live more than 100 leagues to the east... more than 100 leagues to the west... more than 100 leagues to the north... more than 100 leagues to the south.' Thus they get the disciple to undertake kindness &amp; sympathy to some beings, but not to others.</p>
<p class="last">&quot;On the Uposatha day, they get their disciple to undertake the following practice: 'Here, my good man. Having stripped off all your clothing, say this: &quot;I am nothing by anything or of anything. Thus there is nothing by anything or of anything that is mine.&quot;' Yet in spite of that, his parents know of him that 'This is our child.' And he knows of them that 'These are my parents.' His wives &amp; children know of him that 'This is our husband &amp; father.' And he knows of them that 'These are my wives &amp; children.' His workers &amp; slaves know of him that 'This is our master.' And he knows of them that 'These are my workers &amp; slaves.' Thus at a time when he should be persuaded to undertake truthfulness, he is persuaded to undertake falsehood. At the end of the night, he resumes the consumption of his belongings, even though they aren't given back to him. This counts as stealing, I tell you. Such is the Uposatha of the Jains, Visakha. When this Uposatha of the Jains is undertaken, it is not of great fruit or great benefit, not of great glory or great radiance.</p>
</td>
<td><p class="first">“那么，何为耆那的布萨? 有称为尼乾子的沙门(指耆那教徒)。他们命弟子如此修持:‘如此，善男子。对居于东面一百多里的有情放下棍杖……对居于西面一百多里的有情……对居于北面一百多里的有情……对居于南面一百多里的有情放下棍杖。'如此，他们命弟子对某些有情、但不对其他有情施以仁慈与同情。</p>
<p class="last">“布萨日时，他们命弟子如此修持:‘如此，善男子。把你的所有衣服脱去，说:“对于任何依赖或隶属之事而言，我什么也不是。因此没有什么依赖我或隶属我。”'尽管如此，他的父母识得他:‘这是我们的孩子。'他识得他们:‘这是我的父母。'他的妻儿识得他:‘这是我们的丈夫、父亲。'他识得他们:‘这是我的妻儿。'他的雇工与家奴识得他:‘这是我们的主人。'他识得他们:‘这是我的雇工与家奴。'因此，在他应被劝诫持守真语时却被劝诫持守妄语。夜尽时，他恢复对自己所有物的享受，尽管它们并未归还给他。我告诉你，这算偷窃。毗沙卡，耆那的布萨即是如此。持守这等耆那的布萨，是无大果报、大利益，无大荣耀、大光明的。</p>
